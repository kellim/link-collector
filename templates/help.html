<h3>Collections, Categories, and Links</h3>
<p>Collections are a parent category of the type of links you want to
save, with categories being subcategories of the collection. Each category
has links within it that relate to that category.</p>

<p>For instance you might have a Collection called "Recipes", and
within that collection you have categories like "Breakfast", "Entrees", and "Desserts".
You would then add links to breakfast recipes in the "Breakfast" category, and links to
"Desserts" in the desserts category, etc.</p>

<h3>Navigating the Site</h3>
<p>The homepage lists collections. Once you click on a collection, it'll take you to
a page that lists categories with links. You'll start out on the default category, but
can choose a different category from the sidebar. You can also choose a
different collection from the sidebar.</p>

<h3>Logging in to the Site</h3>
<p>Currently, you can log in to the site with a Google+ or a Facebook account. If you
do not have either of these types of accounts, you'll need to obtain one to be able to
login to this site.</p>

<h3>Adding, Editing, and Deleting Links</h3>
<p>Login with either Google+ or Facebook to add a link to the appropriate Collection and
Category. Once you sign in, you'll see an "Add New Link" button at the bottom of the
page for the page that has a category and it's associated links on it.</p>

<p>You can only edit and delete links that you have added. If you added the link, it
will have a pencil icon and a trash can icon next to it. The pencil icon will take you
to a form where you can edit the link. The trash can icon will delete the link once
you confirm you want to delete it.</p>

<h3>Issues, Suggestions, etc</h3>
If you have any issues with the site, or have suggestions, such as collections or
categories you'd like to see added to the site, click the Contact link in the top
navbar to contact the site developer/admin about it.
