<h3 class="help">Collections, Categories, and Links</h3>
<p class="info">Links are contained in categories, and categories are all part of a more general
collection. For instance, you might have a collection called <em>Recipes</em>, and
within that collection you have categories like <em>Breakfast</em>, <em>Entrees</em>, and
<em>Desserts</em>. You would then add links to breakfast recipes in the <em>Breakfast</em> category, and
links to desserts in the <em>Desserts</em> category, etc.</p>

<h3 class="help">Navigating the Site</h3>
<p class="info">Once you click on a collection on the main page, it'll take you to
a page that lists categories with links. You'll start out on the default category, but
can choose a different category from the sidebar. You can also choose a
different collection from the sidebar.</p>

<h3 class="help">Logging in to the Site</h3>
<p class="info">Click the Login button in the top navigation bar to go to the login page that has
your options for logging in.</p>
<p class="info">Currently, you can login to the site with a Google+ or a Facebook account. If you
do not have either of these types of accounts, you'll need to obtain one before you can
login to this site.</p>
<p class="info">Once you have logged in, you'll see a Logout button in place of the Login button.</p>


<h3 class="help">Adding, Editing, and Deleting Links</h3>
<p class="info">To add a link, you'll need to login first.
Once you login and choose a collection, you'll be on the page that lists links for a category.
This page will have an <em>Add New Link</em> button at the bottom which will allow you to add a link.</p>

<p class="info">Once you add a link, it will show up in the list of links with a pencil icon and a
trash can icon next to it. The pencil icon will take you to a form where you can edit the link.
The trash can icon will delete the link once you confirm you want to delete it.</p>

<p class="info">Please add only quality links that pertain to the category they are
posted in. They must also not be spam or promote hatred or anything illegal. Links that do
not meet these standards will be removed from the site.</p>
